We're glad to announce that after 1 month of development work, H3IMD3LL v1.0.x is currently live. Now, H3IMD3LL can take in data from disparate sources at scale using our custom ETL Pipeline. we'll post a link to the demo in the next few weeks displaying the variety of use cases H3IMD3LL can provide to you.

**v1.0.x** is a milestone for by our engineers, since now without any extra engineering work from our customers the platform can take in their data and use it to achieve **factual reasoning** using various LLMs.

Now, we look to push H3IMD3LL to v1.0.0, by then features such as; **automated reasoning**, **WHAT-IF simulations**, **self-learning** will be added to our Hofund offering. Stay tuned to hear more from our Engineers about these improvements.
