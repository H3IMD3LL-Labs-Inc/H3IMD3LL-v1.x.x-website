After weeks of working on H3IMD3LL and getting it to v1.0.x we've decided to move away from the platform entirely. We realised we were working on a solution that needed a problem and worse yet, we were only fueled by the possible financial gain. These circumstances led to we, the Engineering Team, feeling as if we were forcing ourselves, constantly, to work on something that we did not want to work or would be able to benefit a small group of users in the shortest time possible, which is why we shifted to Open-Source Tools.

H3IMD3LL Labs will still work to provide solutions to people, whether it is; Engineers, Professionals or the general public, but with a focus on open-sourcing these tools with optional paid-support. Currently our first of these new set of tools is a **Semantic Log Search System** that sits alongside traditional log storage systems like Loki/ELK.

While working on H3IMD3LL(our first large project any of us has worked on) we had trouble understanding how various system logs we related to each other and what these relations meant with regard to how whatever the problem was could be solved. Dennis [My Email] suggested we implement a system we could use to compare and understand these relations, nevertheless, we decided to shelve that idea that weekend and keep working on H3IMD3LL v1.0.x, fortunately or unfortunately, Dennis(again, me) kept working on the idea and published the v1.x.x repo on GitHub yesterday(as of publication of this post). Now, the team as well as myself will be working on this over the weekend to atleast get it to v1.0.x, the repo will be made public as soon as we a functional v1.0.x so anyone can modify or contribute to it, we'll also include it as a subscription as part of our new and improved H3IMD3LL Cloud offering. Let me get back to work, and see y'all on Monday(2025-9-01).
