Put simply, H3IMD3LL is a data analytics platform that allows you to extract data from disparate sources, combine them into a knowledge graph and use that knowledge graph to reason through the **Why, Where, When and How** of the data.

H3IMD3LL achieves this through a comibination of robust ETL pipelines as well as **Hofund**, our very own proprietary AI Agent that passes your data to a reasoning LLM and takes an action based off of the response from the LLM.
