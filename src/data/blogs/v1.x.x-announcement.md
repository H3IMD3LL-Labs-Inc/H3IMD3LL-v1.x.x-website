Put simply, H3IMD3LL is a data analytics platform that allows you to extract data from disparate sources, combine them into a knowledge graph and use that knowledge graph to reason through **Why, Where, When and How** of the data.

H3IMD3LL achieves this through a comibination of robust ETL pipelines as well as **Hofund**, it's very own AI Agent that passes your data to a reasoning LLM and takes an action based off of the response. The action to be taken in question is up to you. Visit the OSS project at [H3IMD3LL-v1.x.x](https://github.com/H3IMD3LL-Labs-Inc/H3IMD3LL-v1.x.x) to contribute and learn more about H3IMD3LL's development.
